    Host and Raid Dashboard
</h4>

<p align='center'>
    The Grafana dashboard was created to monitor a Btrfs RAID1 with two devices and the host of the RAID.
    It provides a visual representation of system performance, storage usage, and other key metrics to
    ensure effective monitoring and maintenance of the setup.

<h6 align='center'>
    The Grafana dashboard is running on a Raspberry Pi (RPI), providing monitoring for the Btrfs RAID1 and the host system.
